# wqts-geocode-script
### Python script for company use when geocoding address batches 
#### Requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). All other dependencies will be installed automagically.
If you're comfortable running python scripts, just run it normally
If you're new to python scripts:
## Mac OS:
- open terminal
- drag "address_geocoder.py" into the window. A directory should appear
- Hit enter. Assuming python is installed correctly, it will run
## Windows:
- I'll write a batch file for you at some point. 
- For now, I don't have access to a PC, and cannot document a surefire method.
- Sorry :(
